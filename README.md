<h1>Bikesharing</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Investors are currently looking at a request to invest in a bike sharing program in Des Moines.  Data from New York City's CitiBike bike sharing business has been used to create visualizations with the intent to provide investors with information relevant to their investment decision.</p>
<br>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis consists of a number of analysis each of which is explained below.</p>
<br>
<h3>Top Bike Stations</h3>
<p>The first analysis consists of a map of starting points with each starting point being represented by a circle on the map.  The color of these circles darkens based on popularity.  From this map we can see that the most popular starting points are reflective of their appeal to tourists.  As the points move outside of tourist areas the numbers drop.</p>

<br>
<h3>August Peak Hours</h3>
<p>The second analysis shows the checkout times for which the most popular times are the hours of 5 and 6 pm.  This provides somewhat of a contradiction to the note in the first analysis that would indicate that tourism is a driving factor.  If the number of riders were driven only by tourism you would expect that there would be no particular spike in usage at the 5 and 6 pm hours. Of note also is the 8 am time frame which is the 3rd most popular time of checkout.</p>

<br>
<h3>Trip Duration</h3>
<p>The third analysis shows trip durations.  It is interesting that the largest number of riders checked out a bike for only 5 minutes.  If in fact the riders are due to tourism this may make sense in that tourists may simply check out a bike near one tourist destination only to check the bike in once they arrive at the next tourist destination. Additional analysis is required to determine why the highest trip duration is only 5 minutes.</p>

<br>
<h3>Checkout Time for Users by Gender</h3>
<p>The fourth analysis shows trip durations by gender.  This analysis tells us that males generaly ride for longer durations, however, it levels off as the duration inceases.  As noted previously addition analysis is required to determine why the highest duration is only 5 minutes.</p>

<br>
<h3>Checkout Time by Weekday</h3>
<p>The fifth analysis shows checkout times by weekday.  This shows us that although usage on weekends is more consistent throughout the day it is weekday mornings and late afternoon that are the most popular times.  The only exception to this being Wednesday and Friday late afternoons in which demand weakens.  Once again this contradits the theory that the New York City bike sharing is driven by tourism given the times of popularity.</p>

<br>
<h3>Checkout Time by Weekday by Gender</h3>
<p>The sixth analysis shows checkout times by weekday by gender.  The times are consistent with our previous analysis, however, it also shows that the majority of riders are male.  As with previous analysis this would contradict that tourism is driving the market as you would expect that the ridership would be more equally dispersed between males and females if it was predominately tourism related.</p>

<br>
<h3>Trips by Weekday by Gender and by Type; Subscriber or Customer</h3>
<p>The finaly analysis shows trips by weekday by gender and by type; subscriber and customer.  This shows us once again that riders are predominately male.  It also shows us that the majority of riders are subscribers. Once again the most popular days are weekdays rather than weekends with the exception of Wednesday which is similiar to weekends.  When looking at customers the riders appear to be evenly split between male and females which would be consistent with tourists.  </p>

<br>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Although one would expect that bike sharing in New York City would be driven by tourism it is clear from the analysis that this is not the case.  From checkout times to subscribers to gender it is clear there is another driver to the popularity of bike sharing.  NEED TO PROVIDE FURTHER ANALYSIS REQUIRED</p>
